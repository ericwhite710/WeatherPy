# WeatherPy
## Overview
In this challenge I practiced retrieving and analyzing weather data for a hypothetical travel company, furthering knowledge of Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy statistics.

## Summary
For the first deliverable, I generated 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data, then created a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data. Then employed input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. I mapped the destinations with a marker layer map with pop-up markers. Finally, I 
used the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations.
